    <i>JaplScript</i> is a "less than perfect" bridge from Java to AppleScript.
    It allows you to generate Java interfaces based on <code>.sdef</code>
    files, which contain "scripting dictionaries". These scripting dictionaries
    essentially describe the AppleScript interface of an application and can
    be viewed and exported using the macOS <em>Script Editor</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The generated Java interfaces are filled with life using object invocation
    handlers, essentially allowing a program to interact with an AppleScript-enabled
    application, almost as if it had a Java interface.
</p>
<p>
    To generate Java interfaces, use the provided Ant task
    <code>com.tagtraum.japlscript.generation.Generator</code>:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
&lt;taskdef name="japlscript"
         classname="com.tagtraum.japlscript.generation.Generator"
         classpathref="some.classpath"/&gt;<br>
&lt;japlscript application="Music"
    sdef="src/main/resources/Music.sdef"
    out="generated-sources/main/java"
    packagePrefix="com.apple.music"/&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
    As you can see in the sample above, you may need to provide a <code>.sdef</code>
    scripting dictionary (in this case the Music.app),
    an output path (here: <code>generated-sources/main/java</code>), and
    a package prefix (here: <code>com.apple.music</code>).
</p>
<p>
    Once you have generated the interfaces, you can get a reference to the scriptable
    application using the method <code>com.tagtraum.japlscript.JaplScript.getApplication()</code>
    with the generated application interface and the application name as arguments:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
        com.apple.music.Application app = com.apple.music.Application.getInstance();</code>
</p>
